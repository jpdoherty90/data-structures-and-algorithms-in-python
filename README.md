# data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python

  These are my solutions to the end-of-chapter problems in the book "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python" by Goldwasser,
Goodrich, and Tomassia.  

If you see any mistakes in my solutions, please message me and let me know.  If you think my code is
inefficient and you have a better solution, then definitely message me and tell me how to imporove it.
